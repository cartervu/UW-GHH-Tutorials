    "Welcome to the Generic Heavy Higgs (GHH) project! Our focus is the theorized generic heavy higgs boson, and we aim to simulate its behavior and its production in order to better understand how we might be able to find it in LHC experiments. The arxiv paper is here:\n",

    "Madgraph is a software that generates random particle collision data based on the types of collisions you tell it to simulate. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Madgraph5 and Build Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you download anything, you'll want to create a directory for all the software we'll be donwloading (let's call it \"Software\"). Check that the folder isn't in a location where it's being saved to the cloud (i.e. desktop on macs), since that can get expensive fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run madgraph, you'll need a version of python 2 equal to or higher than 2.6. and ROOT, which in turn requires xcode and xcode command line tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you installed Anaconda with python 2, this should work just fine. \n",
    "\n",
    "The root build prerequisites can be found here: https://root.cern.ch/build-prerequisites#macosx. As they might vary from time to time, I am hesitant to give a list here that might become out of date, so check the website and follow their instructions for the prerequisite instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROOT can be installed from https://root.cern.ch/downloading-root. Click on the \"pro\" version at the bottom of the page and download the appropriate tarball. If there is a command instead (probably starting with \"curl\", then copy that into your shell and run it). DO NOT INSTALL CMAKE AND ATTEMPT TO BUILD ROOT LOCALLY AS THIS IS A MASSIVE WASTE OF TIME.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can download madgraph5. The download is here:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://madgraph.physics.illinois.edu/\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make an account for free at the madgraph website and download it from the \"downloads (needs account)\" tab.* Next, move the tarball into your software directory and untar it by using \"tar -xvf MadGraph5 v1.4.4.tar.gz\" in the shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested: the x means you're untaring it (c will create a tarball), and the v means you want to monitor the process. More information on options can be found here: https://www.quora.com/What-does-f-mean-in-terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "cd into your new madgraph directory (should be named something like \"MG5_aMC_v2_6_7\") and ls to look at all the folders. Look around, just to get a basic sense of what's going on. It's ok if you don't understand anything yet, just hold on!\n",
    "\n",
    "Check to see that it's installed correctly by using \"./bin/mg5_aMC\" from your madgraph folder.** If it works, you can then use \"exit\" to exit back to the shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if it doesn't work (and it likely won't), go to https://github.com/davidchall/homebrew-hep and read through the README, before installing ruby and homebrew and letting homebrew install everything else for you.\n",

    "#### Footnotes\n",

Each model is an implementation of a theory of what new physics looks like, which can be used to simulate data from the LHC that can be checked against actual data to test the model's validity.\n",

    "\n",
    "For now, let's try using a model whose components should be relatively straightforward to understand, higgs effective field theory (HEFT). In madgraph, type \"import model heft\" and it should produce some new particles. Try generating the process p p > z h, z > vl vl~, h > a a\n",

    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Output (can be skipped)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you poke around in your Madgraph output, you'll find an .LHE file. LHE files contain a simplified version of the data from your MG5 run with simple jet clustering performed. Here's a brief rundown on what they contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) They specify all the cuts you, your model, and MG5 made at the beginning of the generation process. A cut is effectively a threshold for particles: maybe we don't care about any protons that are produced with momentum less than 0.5 GeV, and throw them all out since that's not where new physics lies. This would be one example of a cut. Madgraph5 automatically does this for a variety of high-energy physics (hep) quantities like pt (transverse momentum), helicity, rapidity, pseudorapidity, etc., so that we can cut out a lot of different particles and minimize the work our computers have to do to simulate our physics processes. While we could simulate every particle and do this at the end of the process, only looking at the data from these particles that we care about, each particle we simulate takes up valuable computer resources, so it is ideal to simulate as little as possible and make as many cuts as possible at the beginning in the generation with MG5. Most of this info comes from the run card.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) They specify all the input parameters describing the interactions that come from the param_card, the model, and probably some stuff from MG5 presets (I don't fully understand each line of the .LHE file, so contact me if you have some relevant knowledge!). Let's say we wanted to see what happens if the Yukawa coupling was different or our theorized GHH had a different mass. We can do that! And all the stuff we told it to do shows up in the LHE file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) They specify the relevant hep properties of each particle it simulates for each event. I'm not sure the exact format within each event, but I'm relatively certain that the first value of each line relates it to a relevant property (It likely uses the MC numbering scheme, but I'm not sure. Here's the scheme for reference: http://pdg.lbl.gov/2019/reviews/rpp2019-rev-monte-carlo-numbering.pdf). For instance, in the GHH file output, the number 254 is correlated with the GHH, so I would assume that whenever it lists 254 at the start of a line, it's describing the relevant quantities of the GHH wherever it appeared in the production channel, and that each other \"index\" number is correlated with a given particle. As I'm not entirely sure of the exact format of what each value in a line is, you'd have to check with someone who's worked more with LHE files. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're feeling especially confident in your coding skills, you can create a PyROOT or C++/ROOT macro that will take in the information from the .LHE file and produce some simple plots. A template macro called \"EventProcess1.cc\" should be in the github repository. It provides an example of how to read the relevant information from the .LHE file into a .txt file so you can plot it. Try your hand at understanding it, and if you get some plots, check your plots with the ones produced by MadAnalysis!****\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you want all the data produced by a run so you can pass it to a detector response simulation program like Delphes, you'll have to use the .hepmc file (tutorial coming soon!)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have now generated some basic collision data in the GHH model and completed the first step towards reproducing the graphs from the GHH paper.****\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Footnote\n",
    "\n",
    "***These processes represent the particle decay pathways that we're interested in. In plain english, the first line can be read as: two protons collide and decay into a z boson and a heavy Higgs boson. The z boson decays into two opposite-sign leptons (if you check the multiparticle definition, this is either a muon or an electron), while the heavy Higgs boson decays into four \"j\" particles (again, check the multiparticle definitions--a j can be either a first or second generation quark, or a gluon).\n",
